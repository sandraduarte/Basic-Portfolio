			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<img src="/basic-portfolio/assets/images/selfimage.jpg" alt="my picture" style="width:128px;height:128px;">
			<p>Hi! My name is Sandra, I'm a Lash Artist by day, and wannabe developer by night. I grew up in Piscataway, NJ and since I've returned, I've become an entrepreneur and started my lash business. Given my past work experience problem solving and supporting others at a company flowing with proprietary technology, I noticed the void in tech and resources for Lash Artists to easily find information in <u>one place</u> and sought to create a crowd sourcing platform with features similar to what we use on Yelp, Facebook, Google, Instagram, and others, but for the lash culture.
